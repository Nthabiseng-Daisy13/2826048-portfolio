What i learned:

I learned how to create, initialize, and use a Git repository, as well as how to clone a repository onto my local machine and work from the terminal in VS Code. I gained an understanding of core Git commands including adding files, committing changes, creating branches, and merging branches into the main branch. I also learned how to use semantic HTML5 elements correctly. Additionally, I learned the importance of writing clear and specific commit messages to make tracking changes easier. I learned about pull requests when merging branches together and how to debug and improve my files.
