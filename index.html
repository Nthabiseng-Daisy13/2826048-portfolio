            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project was creating a website to provide career guidance to highschool learners. The platform offers information on various career paths, subject requirements, and study options, helping learners make informed decisions about their future. The user completes a short quiz, and then AI analyses their answer and gives them their most suitable career field and what options to explore. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and python.</p>
