            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> I am a third year computer science student at the university of the Witwatersrand. I am a highly motivated and goal-driven individual who is passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and contribute meaningfully to South Africa’s future. 
            I am particularly interested in data science, machine learning, and software development—fields that are shaping the future of our society. Beyond the classroom, I actively participate in hackathons, coding challenges, and student-led tech communities to apply my skills in practical settings.

            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>My latest project was creating a website to provide career guidance to highschool learners. The platform offers information on various career paths, subject requirements, and study options, helping learners make informed decisions about their future. The user completes a short quiz, and then AI analyses their answer and gives them their most suitable career field and what options to explore. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and python.</p>
